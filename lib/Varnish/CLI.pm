=head1 NAME

Varnish::CLI - An interface to the Varnish CLI

=head1 VERSION

Version::CLI 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Varnish CLI is a great administration tool, but a bit difficult to script for.
This module allows easy script interface to it.

    use Varnish::CLI;
    my $varnish = Varnish::CLI->new( host    => $host,
                                     port    => $port,
                                     timeout => $timeout,
                                     secret  => $secret,
                                );
    $varnish->send( 'url.purge .*' );

The Varnish::CLI can be initialised without any parameters, and will usually work for the default
Varnish settings:

    my $varnish = Varnish::CLI->new();

If you have started your Varnish CLI with a secret, you must will have to pass the contents
of your secret file, otherwise authentication will fail...  Makes sense!! :)
Remember - complete contents of the secret file (including a newline if it exists!)

    my $varnish = Varnish::CLI->new( secret => $secret );
